# Startpage

Simple startpage for web browser that I created for ricing my desktop environment. Features:

* DuckDuckGo Search bar
* Links to Google Drive, Gmail, Github, Reddit and 4chan

# Usage 
You can clone the repo and point the browser to this repo's index.html or you can use this GitHub hosted [address](erkhal.github.io/startpage). Mind you that the pywal colors do not work when using this site from the remote address.

Because of security reasons, web browser extensions cannot have full access to local files. This is why this repo is hosted on GitHub, so anyone can use this page for a new tab-page as well. You can also host the page on a local web-server, which there are plenty of online tutorials for.

## PyWal colors
This startpage is designed to work with [PyWal color theming](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

To use them, copy this startpage for yourself locally and uncomment the 
CSS rules regarding PyWal color integration. Also remember to correct 
the url for the pywal cached file.
