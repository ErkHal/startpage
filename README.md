# Start page for browser

Simple startpage I created for ricing my Arch Linux desktop environment. Features:

* DuckDuckGo Search bar
* Links to Google Drive, Github, Reddit and 4chan

## PyWal colors
This startpage is designed to work with [PyWal color theming](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

To use them, copy this startpage for yourself locally and uncomment the 
CSS rules regarding PyWal color integration. Also remember to correct 
the url for the pywal cached file.
